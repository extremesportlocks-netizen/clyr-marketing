    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Clyr Health, LLC ("Clyr Health," "we," "us," or "our") operates the website located at <a href="https://www.clyr.health">www.clyr.health</a> and any related sites or applications (collectively, the "Platform"). Your access to and use of the Platform, including all associated content, features, products, or services (collectively, the "Service"), is governed by this Privacy Policy unless expressly stated otherwise.</p>
    <p>Capitalized terms not defined in this Privacy Policy have the meanings assigned to them in the Clyr Health Terms and Conditions.</p>
    <p>We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting the personal information you share with us. This Privacy Policy explains how Clyr Health collects, uses, stores, and discloses information in connection with providing the Service.</p>
    <p>By accessing, registering for, or using the Service, you acknowledge and agree to the practices described in the most current version of this Privacy Policy. Updates will be posted on this page, and the "Last Updated" date will be revised accordingly.</p>
    <p>If you access the Service on behalf of another individual, you confirm that you are authorized to do so and that the individual has reviewed and agreed to this Privacy Policy.</p>

    <h2>Use by Minors</h2>
    <p>The Service is intended for individuals who are at least eighteen (18) years old or the minimum age required under applicable state law. The Platform is not designed to attract or be used by children under 18. If we learn that we have collected personal information from a minor, we will take reasonable steps to discontinue use and retention of that information, unless retention is required by law.</p>
    <p>Certain information may be retained when legally required, when maintained as part of a medical record by providers, when posted or stored by third parties, when anonymized, or when compensation has been provided for the content.</p>

    <h2>Protected Health Information</h2>
    <p>Certain information collected or processed through the Service may constitute Protected Health Information ("PHI") as defined under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 ("HIPAA") and applicable state laws.</p>
    <p>Clyr Health, LLC is not a healthcare provider and does not independently provide medical care. However, in certain circumstances, Clyr Health may receive, maintain, transmit, or process PHI on behalf of affiliated medical providers, medical groups, or pharmacies. In those circumstances, Clyr Health acts as a Business Associate under HIPAA and handles PHI in accordance with applicable Business Associate Agreements ("BAAs"), HIPAA regulations, and applicable state laws.</p>
    <p>PHI may include individually identifiable information relating to an individual's health condition, healthcare services, or payment for healthcare services, whether past, present, or future, when such information is created, received, maintained, or transmitted on behalf of a covered entity.</p>
    <p>Information that has been properly de-identified in accordance with HIPAA standards is not considered PHI and is not subject to HIPAA requirements.</p>
    <p>Where Clyr Health processes PHI as a Business Associate, the use and disclosure of that PHI is governed by applicable BAAs and the Notice of Privacy Practices of the applicable healthcare provider or pharmacy, not by this Privacy Policy except as required by law.</p>

    <h2>Information We Collect</h2>

      <li>Comply with legal obligations</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Use of PHI</h3>
    <p>Clyr Health does not use PHI for advertising, marketing, or behavioral profiling. PHI is used solely for purposes permitted under HIPAA, including supporting treatment, payment, healthcare operations, and related administrative functions, as authorized by applicable covered entities and BAAs.</p>
    <p>PHI is not shared with advertising networks, social media platforms, or data brokers, and tracking technologies are not used in connection with workflows involving PHI where prohibited by law.</p>
    <p>We may aggregate or de-identify data and use it for lawful business purposes.</p>

    <h2>Disclosure of Information</h2>

      <li>As otherwise permitted or required under HIPAA, applicable BAAs, or state law</li>
    </ul>
    <p>When acting as a Business Associate, Clyr Health discloses PHI only as permitted by HIPAA and applicable BAAs.</p>
    <p>We do not sell PHI and do not disclose PHI for targeted advertising purposes.</p>

    <h2>Your Rights and Choices</h2>
    <p>Depending on your location, you may have rights to:</p>
    <ul>

      <li>Limit use of sensitive personal information</li>
      <li>Designate an authorized agent</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Requests may require identity verification.</p>

    <h2>Data Retention</h2>
    <p>Clyr Health retains information as long as reasonably necessary to provide services, comply with legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce agreements. Retention periods may vary for affiliated providers and third parties.</p>

    <h2>Payments and Transactions</h2>
    <p>Payment processing is handled by Stripe. Clyr Health does not control Stripe's data practices. Stripe's privacy policies apply to payment transactions.</p>

    <h2>Jurisdiction</h2>
    <p>The Service is governed by U.S. law and may only be used in states where services are offered.</p>

    <h2>California Privacy Rights</h2>
    <p>California residents have rights under the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), including rights to access, delete, correct, and opt out of certain data sharing. We do not knowingly sell or share the personal information of minors under 16.</p>

    <h2>Security</h2>
    <p>We use reasonable administrative, technical, and physical safeguards to protect information. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account credentials.</p>

    <h2>Updates to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Material changes will be posted and may require acknowledgment.</p>

    <h2>HIPAA Notice of Privacy Practices (Business Associate)</h2>
    <p>This Notice applies only to circumstances in which Clyr Health, LLC acts as a Business Associate under HIPAA on behalf of a covered healthcare provider or pharmacy.</p>
    <p>In those circumstances, Clyr Health may use and disclose PHI solely as permitted by applicable Business Associate Agreements, HIPAA regulations, and other applicable laws.</p>
    <p>Individuals' rights regarding PHI — including rights to access, amend, receive an accounting of disclosures, request restrictions, request confidential communications, and receive breach notifications — are governed by the Notice of Privacy Practices of the applicable healthcare provider or pharmacy, not directly by Clyr Health.</p>
    <p>Clyr Health supports covered entities in fulfilling HIPAA obligations but does not independently determine patient rights outside the scope of applicable BAAs.</p>
